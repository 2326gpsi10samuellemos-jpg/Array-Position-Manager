# Array Position Manager (C#)

This project is a simple C# console application that demonstrates array manipulation.  
The user can insert numbers into specific positions of a fixed-size array (10 elements).  
After storing the desired values, the program can display all elements ordered by their defined positions.

## Features
- Insert numbers into chosen array positions  
- Store multiple values until the array is filled  
- Display elements ordered by position  
- Simple and clear console interface  

## Technologies
- C#  
- .NET (Console Application)  
- Visual Studio  

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository  
2. Open the solution file (`.sln`) in Visual Studio  
3. Build and run the program  

## Purpose
This project was developed as part of my studies in **Management and Programming of Information Systems**.  
It showcases my ability to work with:
- Arrays and indexed data structures  
- User input and data validation  
- Basic program flow in C#
